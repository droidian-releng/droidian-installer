# Droidian Installer 

Fear not! Installing [Droidian](https://droidian.org) on your [device](https://devices.droidian.org) is easy! Just download the Droidian Installer package for your operating system and sit back and relax while your computer does all the rest. Installing third-party operating systems has never been so easy!

## Config files

By default, the Installer will always use the latest version of the [installation configuration files](https://github.com/droidian-devices/installer-configs) available. Should you want to specify a custom config file, you can do that by starting the Installer with the `-f ./path/to/config.yml` argument. This can be used to test changes to the configuration or even to add new devices to the installer. The [structure of the config files is specified here](https://github.com/droidian-devices/installer-configs#readme).

## Logs

If the installer runs into an error, it will usually present you with the option to create a bug report. It is always a good idea to make use of that feature, because that way the developers will almost always have all the information they need to help you. If you still have to look at the log file for some reason, you can find it in `~/.cache/droidian/droidian-installer.log` on linux (or `~/snap/droidian-installer/current/.cache/droidian/droidian-installer.log` if you're using the snap package). On Windows, it will be located at `%APPDATA%\droidian\droidian-installer.log` and on macOS you can find it under `$HOME/Library/Caches/droidian/droidian-installer.log`.
